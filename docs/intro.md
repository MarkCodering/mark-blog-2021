# Welcome
Hi there,

I am Mark, a computer science student from Tamkang University (TKU), Taiwan. I am also a student avionics engineer and software developer at Space Technology Laboratory (STL) at Aerospace Engineering Dept, TKU. My primary responsibility at STL is to develop the avionics software based on the Arduino platform and Zephyr RTOS to leverage the overall system performance based on the previous systems. Also, I am a co-founder of two academic and developer communities, the Google Developer Student Club and Symposium for Quantum AI (SQAI). I provided my experiences in project management and community development to further the impact of emerging technologies like quantum computing and AI applications.
