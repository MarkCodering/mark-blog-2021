# Hi there,

I am Mark, a computer science student, Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, and avionics engineer at Space Technology Lab at TKU. In this post, I would like to share some of my accomplishments and, more importantly, some of my reflections this year to help me envision a better tomorrow next year.

Dear younger self, your story this year is more than just an experience of various projects but an inspirational growth journey. You grew through hardship and learned through struggle. Uncertainty is there, but we define our destiny of the future. 2021 was a year when you grew through entrepreneurship, learning, and friendship. You believe that a growth mindset is more important than other external factors contributing to your success today. 2022 is around the corner when the new year's countdown is ticking. You have grown to become a better version of yourself. And here is your story of 2021.

## MIT Admission

This year, I applied to MIT as a transfer applicant. Throughout going to MIT, I realized my weakness and strengths. Although I got rejected from MIT, I am getting more robust with a solid reflective and growth mindset in mind. It is not the end of my journey to pursue my dream of going to MIT and working with top talents but a new start of my journey by taking a different trajectory and approach to this end goal.

## Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador and Seth

At the beginning of this year, you were accepted to become the only two Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors in Taiwan and start your journey of building a developer community. You then met Seth, a talented computer science student from the U.S and studying here in Taiwan. Together, we hosted the world first quantum AI symposium and had tremendous success in terms of management and content of the delivery. Also, you were invited to co-host various developer events with Seth and NTUAI while furthering my understanding of the relevant field. Moreover, Seth’s story of thriving through hardship and studying abroad inspired me to go further in my university and go to MIT if possible. He is not just a fellow Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador but a good friend and role model to prepare me and propel me to pursue my dream and passion along the way.

## Entrepreneurship and teamee

After months of creativity, you started to fund a start-up team on your campus called teamee. You then partnered with talented students and business partners at Tamkang University to build our business while providing our values to society. You gained a tremendous amount of success during your entrepreneurial competition at Tamkang University while demonstrating an example of positive leadership. Afterwards, you and other partners started to apply for the accelerator programs in Taiwan. You even get in the first round of applications for one of Taiwan’s largest accelerators and VC firms. But, still, there is a lot of improvement that can be made in this journey by building a more decisive leadership style and executing explicit project management, which will contribute to the tremendous success of your entrepreneurial endeavours. Also, it would help if you were well-equipped with the knowledge and skills needed for building a start-up, from writing an app to building a brand. You need to further your understanding of both technology and entrepreneurship, which will increase of possibility of success in your future endeavours.

## University and GPA

So now, you gain more attention and concentration on your courses in university despite the lack of teaching quality remains. The challenges remain explicit, but the solution is there to resolve the problem of attending classes at Tamkang University. 

## Space Technology Lab and Passion

I joined Space Technology Lab (STL) on our campus around the end of August. I was then accepted as the first official member within the lab that is not a part of the aerospace engineering department. I quickly realized that building rockets and embedded systems are my passion. From my high school’s project of building a TVC rocket to the present work of building an avionics system, it reminds me that this is my passion, which I want to pursue in the future.

Also, fellow members avionics team members in the lab are highly supportive. They encourage me to continue looking at stars and forget our dreams and passion for aerospace engineering. They are not just a team but a group of friends pushing me to thrive from now to the future.

## Outlooks

2021 is now over. Challenge remains, but the hope is there. My complex works of being a unique star and pursuing my dream to reach the sky are everlasting. I am much grateful to everyone that help me to thrive, to find, and to light the way of the future. This is our time. The clock is ticking. And, let us remember the past and light the future path where we still pursue our passion and love.

In the end, to everyone with love and passion; thank you,
